            <h3> What Is Coral Bleaching </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A coral's response to stressful conditions.</li>
                <li>Coral expels tiny algae from its tissues, resulting in a loss of color.</li>
                <li>It occurs when corals become white due to the loss of symbiotic algae they rely on.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3> Facts </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>5 times the great barrier reef has experienced a mass bleaching event since 2016</li>
                <li>71% of the world’s coral reefs have likely experienced coral bleaching</li>
                <li>14% of the world coral has been lost from 2009 to 2018</li>
            </ul>
            <h3> Why Does Coral Need Bacteria </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The zooxanthellae that reside in the coral supply nutrients to the coral through photosynthesis.</li>
                <li>They get energy from the sun and use water and carbon dioxide to create oxygen.</li>
                <li>Their main role is supplying the coral with sugars and proteins, the products of photosynthesis.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3> Causes </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Coral bleaching is caused by stress being put on the coral, causing the algae to be expelled</li>
                <li>Stress caused by: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Climate change cause marine heat waves</li>
                        <li>A change as little as 1 degree Ceclsius can cause coral bleaching</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Solar</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Climate change cause marine heat waves</li>
                        <li>A change as little as 1 degree Celsius can cause coral bleaching</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Pollution</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Excess nutrients from agricultural runoffs</li>
                        <li>Causes algae bloom and eutrophication</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h3>Heatwaves</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Heatwaves can last weeks, months or even years</li>
                <li>When maximum and minimum temperatures are unusually hot over 3 days</li>
                <li>If ocean temperatures remain high for eight weeks or longer the coral cannot recover and begins to die</li>
                <li>If a large heatwave hits the reef, it will be in great danger</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Effect On Marine Life</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide shelter, spawning grounds and protection</li>
                <li>A lot of animals that live in reef are organisms eaten by larger animals hence being irreplaceable parts of ecosystem</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Effect On Humans</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Corals naturally absorb force of waves and storm surges keeping many safe Reef tourism</li>
                <li>Overfishing crisis heightened</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="diary-title"> Solution Prototypes </h2>
            <h3>Prototype 1</h3>
            <img src="Images/Diary/Prototype 1.jpg" class="prototype-image">
            <ul>
                <li>This was our first design. It was drawn by Zach, and we all reviewed it after. </li>
                <li>This consisted of a heat sensor which was brought to the bottom of the reef using a weight. </li>
                <li>This would transmit the information of the heat and sensors to the surface to floats. </li>
                <li>These floats hold fans which spin at a rapid pace, hence generating sea foam. </li>
                <li>We decided not to use this design, because of the wire in the way; if it breaks, we will lose all communication with the device. </li>
                <li>The fans on the float could also be dangerous for marine life. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Prototype 2</h3>
            <img src="Images/Diary/Prototype 2.jpg" class="prototype-image">
            <ul>
                <li>This was an improvement on the previous prototype </li>
                <li>Instead of heat sensors, we designed a small, self-driving robot to an analyse the conditions </li>
                <li>It consists of heat sensors to measure the heat of the area </li>
                <li>In addition, it also has a camera for data collection on reef </li>
                <li>The seafoam producer however wasn't efficient and was just big and bulky, and our idea of ejecting pre-made seafoam wouldn't work </li>
                <li>Apart from this we removed the cable and it will now communicate wireless </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Prototype 3</h3>
            <img src="Images/Diary/Prototype 3.jpg" class="prototype-image">
            <ul>
                <li>This was a major improvement on the previous prototype. </li>
                <li>This was drawn by Kang and Zach. </li>
                <li>Jonathan and Xander gave feedback. </li>
                <li>We improved the floats by making them more spherical, and we went back to the old design of fans to generate sea foam, but this time inside the bot and ejecting it out the sea foam </li>
                <li>The 'Gup-V' is the same </li>
                <li>We have anchors for the floats so that they stay in place </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Prototype 4</h3>
            <img src="Images/Diary/Prototype 4.jpg" class="prototype-image">
            <ul>
                <li>For this last prototype, we just added hooks to the anchors to further lock in place </li>
                <li>We neatened up the design sketch </li>
                <li>The wires to the anchor are made of steel so they won't break  </li>
            </ul>
