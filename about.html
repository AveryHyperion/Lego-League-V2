                <h3>Quick Stats</h3>
                <p><strong>Stat 1:</strong> 77% of the world’s coral reef areas have been subjected to bleaching-level heat stress.</p>
                <p><strong>Stat 2:</strong> 14% of the world’s remaining corals have died in the previous two global bleaching events. </p>
                <p><strong>Stat 3:</strong> 74 countries globally have been affected by coral bleaching.</p>

            <!-- What Is It? -->
            <div class="section">
                <h2>What Is It?</h2>
                <p>Coral bleaching happens when corals lose their vibrant colors and turn white and 'dead'. However, there's more to it than what meets the eye, coral are bright and colorful because of microscopic algae called zooxanthellae. The zooxanthellae live within the coral in a mutually beneficial relationship, meaning they're interdependent and rely on one another. But when the ocean environment changes, for when the temperature gets too hot; the coral stresses out and expels the algae. As the algae leaves, the coral fades until it looks like it’s been bleached. If the temperature stays high, the coral won’t let the algae back, and the coral will eventually die.</p>

            <!-- What Triggers It? -->
            <div class="section">
                <h2>What Triggers It?</h2>
                <p>The leading cause of coral bleaching is climate change. A warming planet means a warming ocean, and a change in water temperature as little as 1 degrees celcius cause coral to drive out algae. However, there are also a variety of other reasons, like extremely low tides, pollution, or too much sunlight.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Why Does It Matter -->
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Why Does It Matter</h2>
                <p>Coral bleaching matters because once these corals die, reefs rarely come back. With few corals surviving, they struggle to reproduce, and entire reef ecosystems, on which people and wildlife depend, deteriorate. </br> </br>
                    Bleaching also matters because it’s not an isolated phenomenon. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, between 2014 and 2017 around 75% of the world’s tropical coral reefs experienced heat-stress severe enough to trigger bleaching. For 30% of the world’s reefs, that heat-stress was enough to kill coral.</p>
