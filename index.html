            <p class="custom-paragraph-2">
                Why Does Coral Need This Bacteria Anyway? </br>
                The zooxanthellae that resides in the coral supply nutrients to the coral through photosynthesis. They get energy from the sun and use the water and carbon dioxide to create oxygen. Their main role is supplying the coral with sugars and proteins, the products of photosynthesis. </br> </br>
            </p> 
            <p class="custom-paragraph-3"> 
                Stress </br>
                Heat: Climate change causes Marine heatwaves.
                A change as little as 1° Celsius can cause this coral bleaching </br>
                Solar: UV Radiation damages the corals DNA, as well as the symbiotic algae cell structures </br>
                Pollution: Excess nutrients from agricultural runoff, cause algae bloom, blocking sun for the zooxanthellae.
                Sediment can also settle and block sun. </br> </br>                  
            </p>
            <p class="custom-paragraph-4"> 
                Heatwaves </br>
                Heatwaves can last weeks, months or even years. </br>
                Heatwaves are when maximum and minimum temperatures are unusually hot over 3 days. </br>
                If ocean temperatures remain high for eight weeks or longer, the coral cannot recover and begins to die. It is clear that if a large heatwave hits a reef, it will never recover. </br>

                Corals support many marine life. They provide shelter, spawning grounds and protection from predators. A lot of the animals that live in coral reefs are organisms that are eaten by larger animals, thus being irreplaceable parts of the ecosystem.

            <p class="custom-paragraph-6">
                The clownfish, butterfly fish, angelfish, and surgeonfish, as well as lobster and shrimp all call coral home. Other key creatures are sea turtles, fish, crabs, shrimp, jellyfish, sea birds and starfish. Without these creatures our magnificent coral reefs wouldn't be what they are today.

This will then transmit the information of the heat sensors to the floats on the surface. These floats will hold fans that spin fast which generates sea foam.​​</div>
                    <div class="solution">We decided not to use this design due to the wires in the way, for example; a preliminary error such as it snapping/breaking will result in a loss of communication.</div>

                    <div class="approach">This is an improvement from the previous design; instead of heat sensors, we designed a small, self-driving robot to analyse the conditions. It consists of heat sensors to measure the heat of the area. In addition, it also has a camera for data collection on the targeted reef.</div>
                    <div class="solution">The seafoam producer however wasn't efficient and was just big and bulky, and our idea of ejecting pre-made seafoam wouldn't work. Apart from this, we reomoved the cable and it can now communicate wirelessly.</div>

                    <div class="approach">This was a major improvement on the previous prototype, we improved the floats by making them more spherical, and we went back to the old design of the fan to generate sea foam. However, this time, the boat will be ejecting it out instead.</div>
                    <div class="solution">The 'Gup-V' is similar; we have anchors for each float so that they can stay firmly in place.</div>
